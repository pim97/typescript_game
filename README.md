## About this project

<p align="center">You will be able to mine your favorite Crypto coins in Typescript made with the AngularJS framework. This was made a school assignment and my final grade was a 9.2<p>
<p align="center">You will be able to click the current coin and then sell it at a high price and then buying it back at a lower price. There is a small algorithm in here that determines the next coin price. There's also a graph within this project. You must defeat the AI enemy within 3 minutes to win. </p>
